## Project Overview - Hello There!
Our team has developed an advanced smart gripper system that combines precise control, real-time feedback, and intelligent object handling capabilities. The system features a modern web-based interface with voice control, real-time data visualization, and adaptive control strategies.

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Control System
- **Adaptive Force Control**: Dynamic adjustment of grip force based on object properties like size
- **Real-time Sensor Feedback**: Continuous monitoring using 3D magnetic sensors
- **Smart Object Detection**: Automatic detection of object properties (size, shape)
- **Voice Control Integration**: Natural language command interface

### 2. Advanced User Interface
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live monitoring of force, position, and sensor data
- **Interactive Controls**: Intuitive button and voice command interface
- **Data Analytics**: Comprehensive data logging and analysis tools
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, user-friendly web interface

### 3. Technical Innovations

#### Control System
- **Adaptive PID Control**: A optional PID-control for a constant force grip
- **Force Feedback Loop**: Real-time adjustment using magnetic sensor data
- **Smart Grip Strategy**: 
  - Gripping: torque control + smart object detection to switch from closing to hold
  - Gentle handling of fragile objects
  - Adaptive response to object shape
  - Opening: positional control to open and stop before disengaging gears

#### Hardware Integration
- **Sensor Fusion**: Integration of multiple magnetic sensors for precise feedback
- **Motor Control**: Optimized BLDC motor control with voltage and current monitoring and a variety of control strategies
- **Safety Features**: Automatic limit detection for closing and opening to prevent motor overheating or disengaging of gears

## Technical Implementation

### Hardware Stack
- **Main Controller**: Infineon XMC4700 Relax Kit
- **Sensors**: 
  - TLE5012 for position sensing
  - TLx493D for force and object detection
- **Actuators**: BLDC motor with integrated position feedback

### Software Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based web interface (also supporting different platforms like Windows and Linux)
- **Backend**: Python server with WebSocket support
- **Firmware**: Custom Arduino implementation
- **Communication**: 
  - WebSocket for real-time data
  - Serial protocol for hardware control

### Control Algorithms
1. **PID Tuning System**
   - self tuning by user dependend on hardware condition

2. **Smart Control Strategy**
   - Object property detection (size)
   - Material classification (in future based on force change over time)
   - Force profile optimization (in future)
